## 01. BLACK VOID

**Image:** `new_01_black_void.png`

**Prompt:**
> A cinematic 4K product video. The side table in the image must remain completely unchanged in shape, color, proportions, and surface — no morphing, no deformation. The scene begins in total darkness. The single razor-sharp spotlight slowly fades in from directly above, dramatically revealing the deep matte black side table. The hard light carves deep, graphic shadows on the floor. The camera is completely static. The object never moves. Only the light moves — slow, deliberate, powerful. The atmosphere is cold, confrontational, and runway-like.

## 02. CRIMSON SMOKE

**Image:** `new_02_crimson_smoke.png`

**Prompt:**
> A dramatic 4K product video. The side table must remain completely unchanged in shape, color, proportions, and surface — no morphing, no deformation. The deep crimson red side table sits perfectly still against a black background. Thin wisps of white smoke slowly drift across the frame from left to right, partially obscuring and revealing the sculptural silhouette. A single hard side light creates a sharp edge-light on the table's profile. The camera performs an extremely slow push-in. The object never moves. Only the smoke and camera move. The atmosphere is mysterious, cold, and cinematic.

## 03. WHITE GALLERY

**Image:** `new_03_white_gallery.png`

**Prompt:**
> A 4K architectural video. The side table must remain completely unchanged in shape, color, proportions, and surface — no morphing, no deformation. In a stark white minimalist gallery, the harsh directional sunlight slowly moves across the room, causing the long dramatic shadow of the white side table to sweep across the polished concrete floor. The camera is completely static, capturing the passage of time. The object never moves. Only the light and shadow move. The atmosphere is cold, architectural, and serene.

## 04. ELECTRIC BLUE MIRROR

**Image:** `new_04_electric_blue_mirror.png`

**Prompt:**
> An ultra-smooth 4K product video. The side table and its reflection must remain completely unchanged in shape, color, and proportions — no morphing, no deformation. The camera executes a very slow, seamless vertical tilt-up, starting from the reflection on the mirror floor and rising to the actual electric cobalt blue side table. Cold blue-tinted studio lighting from the sides creates sharp highlights on the edges. The object is perfectly static. Only the camera moves. The atmosphere is cold, futuristic, and bold.

## 05. OLIVE CONCRETE

**Image:** `new_05_olive_concrete.png`

**Prompt:**
> A 4K cinematic lifestyle video. The side table must remain completely unchanged in shape, color, proportions, and surface — no morphing, no deformation. The moody, directional warm-toned spotlight slowly moves across the raw brutalist concrete wall and the deep olive green side table, creating a play of chiaroscuro lighting. The architectural design book on the table remains untouched. The camera performs a very slow, gentle orbit from left to right. The object is static. Only the light and camera move. The atmosphere is sophisticated, editorial, and architecturally refined.

## 06. MUSTARD RUNWAY

**Image:** `new_06_mustard_runway.png`

**Prompt:**
> A high-fashion 4K video. The side table must remain completely unchanged in shape, color, proportions, and surface — no morphing, no deformation. On a dark fashion runway, the overhead spotlights slowly pulse, creating a subtle blooming and dimming effect on the mustard gold side table. The reflection on the glossy black runway floor shimmers accordingly. The camera is completely static. The object never moves. Only the lighting intensity changes. The atmosphere is high-fashion, editorial, and bold.

## 07. BLUSH NEON

**Image:** `new_07_blush_neon.png`

**Prompt:**
> A futuristic 4K product video. The side table must remain completely unchanged in shape, color, proportions, and surface — no morphing, no deformation. In a dark room, the vertical neon white light strip behind the dusty blush pink table slowly flickers on and off with a soft hum. The front of the table remains dimly lit. The camera is static. The object never moves. Only the neon light flickers. The atmosphere is cold, futuristic, and edgy.

## 08. TERRACOTTA ARCH

**Image:** `new_08_terracotta_arch.png`

**Prompt:**
> An architectural 4K lifestyle video. The side table must remain completely unchanged in shape, color, proportions, and surface — no morphing, no deformation. The warm directional sunlight streaming through the concrete arch slowly fades to a cool evening light. The dramatic rim light on the terracotta orange table softens and the shadows lengthen. The pampas grass remains still. The camera is static. The object never moves. Only the light changes, simulating a time-lapse from day to dusk. The atmosphere is bold, warm yet sophisticated.

## 09. CHARCOAL RAIN

**Image:** `new_09_charcoal_rain.png`

**Prompt:**
> A dramatic 4K cinematic video. The side table must remain completely unchanged in shape, color, proportions, and surface — no morphing, no deformation. The heavy rain continues to fall, with water droplets splashing on the glistening surface of the charcoal grey table and the wet black stone ground. The cold blue-white spotlight subtly flickers as if from a distant storm. The camera performs an extremely slow dolly-in. The object is static. Only the rain and camera move. The atmosphere is raw, powerful, and cinematic.

## 10. DUO B&W

**Image:** `new_10_duo_bw.png`

**Prompt:**
> A graphic 4K conceptual video. The two side tables must remain completely unchanged in shape, color, proportions, and surface — no morphing, no deformation. The single overhead spotlight slowly rotates, causing the shared pool of light and the overlapping shadows of the black and white tables to move in a circular motion on the concrete floor. The tables themselves are perfectly static. The camera is static. Only the light and shadows move. The atmosphere is graphic, bold, and conceptual.
